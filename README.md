# School Problems
  In school,we do some math problems on [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) and [PbInfo.ro](https://pbinfo.ro)(using Blockly),except its unbelivably easy.So, i want to remake all of them we did so far,but in Javascript,Lua and Python.
  This really is just a break from all the complexity,and just sit back and code easily.
